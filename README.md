# SMA Crossover Backtesting – RELIANCE.NS

This project implements and tests a 7/21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy on historical data of RELIANCE.NS (NSE) using Python and the `Backtesting.py` library.

## 💡 Strategy Logic

- **Buy** when 7-day SMA crosses above 21-day SMA
- **Sell** when 7-day SMA crosses below 21-day SMA

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- yfinance (data fetching)
- Backtesting.py (backtesting engine)
- pandas

## 📊 Output

The backtest calculates performance metrics like:
- Sharpe Ratio
- Max Drawdown
- Profit/Loss
- Equity Curve

## 🚧 Note

I plan to improve/fix parts of this project over the next few weeks.
